A NodeJS trading bot that when BTC reaches to a value you expect or you want to trade with it automatically trade BTC with a stable coin like USDT (a coin which is literally linked with United States dollar ratio one-to-one) means for every USDT coin it equals one United States dollar.

*I recommend to run it at virtual machine or Raspberry Pi as it saves the wallet private key at txt file which can be compressed.*

just run it and leave it, it's that's simple!
